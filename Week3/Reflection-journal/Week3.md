# Week 3 Reflection

### Peer assessment:

Luka: -

Joonas: 3 He participated in the group competition with me this friday.

### Challenges Faced:

-communicating with my team

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

#### Key learning:

-Overall now understand the react library and express framework.

#### Online Resources:

I W3schools is often useful for help:
https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp

These examples helped me a lot to understand components and props:
https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component

### Coping Strategies:

#### Academic Progress:

-learned about the model–view–controller pattern

-using postman is now a lot clearer to me

-learned the javascript map() method, the spread operator, and object destructuring.

-I know how to create react components with props.

#### Soft Skills Development:

-Pair programming was quite successful. I think we communicated with each other well.

### Project Management:

-when it comes to the project, communication within our team is still poor, and I feel especially responsible. I didn't realize that sprint 1 was after school on Monday, so I made our presentation and prototype on my own free time since after all I came up with our project idea.

### Final Thoughts:

Doing the tasks in the competition especially improved my learning, so I'm glad that me and Joonas participated in it, although I did not do task 5 exactly how it was supposed to be done.

### Next Steps:

-Better team work.
