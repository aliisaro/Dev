# Week 3 Reflection

### Peer assessment:

--

### Challenges Faced:

-Pair programming

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

#### Key learning:

-Connecting frontend and backend has become clearer to me.

#### Online Resources:

### Coping Strategies:

#### Academic Progress:

-learned about the Web Storage API.

-learned how to make hooks

#### Soft Skills Development:

-Pair programming was a bit challenging. We couldn't finish the second task.

### Project Management:

-So far I have only done the base for our project as well as user login and registration. I haven't done more this week because I think I still need more practice.

### Final Thoughts:

-We need to start managing the project better, but the problem is that we're all very passive and none of us wants to be the project manager. I have informed them what I've done in the project but I'm not sure of we're all on the same page.

### Next Steps:

-Continue the project.
