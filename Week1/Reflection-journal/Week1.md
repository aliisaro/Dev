# Week 1 Reflection

### Peer assessment:

Luka Tuononen: 3. It was easy to discuss with him and he seemed to be quite knowledgeable and helpful.

Joonas Saksanen: 2. He participated in a call with us but mostly just listened to us talk and didn't actively try to talk with us.

Me: 3. I initiated conversation and sort of took a "leading" role. I tried my best to go through the 

NOTE: Only time we did group work was on Wednesday during the Scrum Lab activity. Otherwise we did activities independently. I thought we had to engage with each other only if we need help especially because a lot of the activities were pretty easy. So that's why I was confused.


### Challenges Faced:
Even though I have used git before, it was a bit confusing because previously I've only used it in in PyCharm. I also had some difficulty understanding Node because I forgot to watch the tutorial video. Lastly I'm quite introverted so it was a bit challenging to try to chat with my group.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

#### Key learning: 

-An important thing I learned is that it's good to learn how to use AI as a helping tool in development.
-We need to do work together more in our group.

#### Online Resources:

-This video visualized Scrum very well in my opinion.

-This page explains what Node.js is in a nutshell.

These were good Javascript refreshers:

### Coping Strategies:

#### Academic Progress:
- Using git became clearer to me and I learned to use it with Vscode.

- Learned more about Javascript functions (arrow functions, difference between function expressions and statements) and I learned what hoisting is.

- I know basic differences between different development cycles and I understand Scrum better.

- Learned about Node.js and Node Package Panager.


#### Soft Skills Development:

I began talking with my group, tried to share ideas with them. Discussing with my group made the development cycles a lot clearer to me. 

### Project Management:
I think that deciding what roles we are going to take in the project according to the Scrum model will be a bit hard because our group is very small.

### Final Thoughts:
It took some time but I did manage to do all the activities and study in my spare time.

### Next Steps:
I want to listen more actively during lecture because some times I tend to loose focus. I haven't fully understood everything yet so I want to study better in my spare time as well.
